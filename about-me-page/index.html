          <p>
            This is a basic to-do app developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            It enables a user to add daily tasks. Also, a user can mark a task
            “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks
            appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks. There is also a
            separate section titled Pending Tasks for all the tasks that require
            completion. In such a case, the to-do list is a union of the Pending
            Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a
            user is able to delete or edit tasks from it.
